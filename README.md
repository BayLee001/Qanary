# A Reference Implementation for Creating Question Answering Systems following the Qanary Methodology
## Qanary in a Nutshell

Qanary is a Methodology for Creating Question Answering Systems it is part of the [WDAqua project](http://wdaqua.informatik.uni-bonn.de) where question answering systems are researched and developed. Here, we are providing our key contributions on-top of the [RDF vocabulary qa](https://github.com/WDAqua/QAOntology) the reference implementation of the Qanary methodology. This repository contributes several sub-resources for Question Answring Community to build knowledge driven QA systems incorporating a standard [RDF vocabulary qa](https://github.com/WDAqua/QAOntology). All the resources are reusable. For detailed description of individual resources, kindly refer to Wiki section of this repository. In brief, the following sub-projects are available all aiming at establishing an ecosystem for question answering systems.

 * [**Qanary Pipeline**](#qanarypipeline) implementation: a central component where components for question answering systems are connected automatically and can be called by Web UIs
 * Qanary component implementations: components providing wrappers to existing functionality or implement new question answering approaches
   * a [**Qanary component template**](#qanarycomponenttemplate) implementation: use this to build you own component ([howto]()) as it provides [several features]()
   * [**Qanary AGDISTIS**](#qanaryagdists): a wrapper for disambiguating named entity in text using the [AGDISTIS](http://aksw.org/Projects/AGDISTIS.html) (NED) tool
   * [**Qanary Alchemy**](#qanaryalchemy): a wrapper for the [Alchemy Entity Extraction API](http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/alchemylanguage/entity-extraction) (commercial, but offers a free API key) computing named entities and disambiguates them (NER+NED)
   * [**Qanary DBpedia Spotlight NER**](#qanarydbpediaspotlight): a wrapper for the service interface of [DBpedia Spotlight](https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight) spotting named entities within text (NER)
   * [**Qanary DBpedia Spotlight NED**](#qanarydbpediaspotlight): a wrapper for the service interface of [DBpedia Spotlight](https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight) disambiguating named entities within text (NED) to [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org) resources
   * [**Qanary FOX**](#qanaryfox): a wrapper for the [FOX](http://aksw.org/Projects/FOX.html) tool for recognizing named entities within text (NER)
   * [**Qanary Lucene Linker**](#qanarylucenelinker): a tool for recognizing and disambiguating named entities within text derived from an implementation within the [SINA](http://aksw.org/Projects/SINA.html) question answering system (NER+NED)
   * [**Qanary Stanford NER**](#qanarystanfordner): a wrapper for the [Stanford Named Entity Recognizer](http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/) recognizing named entities within text
 * Qanary benchmarking
   * [**QALD evaluator**](#qaldevaluator): a client for the Qanary Pipeline evaluating the capabilities w.r.t. named entity recognition and disambiguation of a given Qanary Pipeline configuration with the [QALD benchmark](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org/) (Question Answering over Linked Data) data
   * [**QALD annotated with named entities**](#qaldnerddataset): questions of [QALD](http://qald.sebastianwalter.org/) annotated with named entities containing

## Publications / References

If you want to inform yourself about the Qanary methodology in general, please use this publication:  *Andreas Both, Dennis Diefenbach, Kuldeep Signh, Saedeeh Shekarpour, Didier Cherix and Christoph Lange: Qanary - A Methodology for Vocabulary-driven Open Question Answering Systems* appearing in [13th Extended Semantic Web Conference](http://2016.eswc-conferences.org), 2016.


## Stuff used to make this:

 * [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project

## How to run the code

 * Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary`

 * Install Java 8 (see <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html> for details)

 * Install maven (see <https://maven.apache.org/install.html> for details)

 * Compile and package your project using maven: `mvn package install`
   The _package_ goal will compile your Java code, run any tests, and finish by packaging the code up in a JAR file within the target directory. The _install_ goal will compile, test, and package your projectâ€™s code and then copy it into the local dependency repository.

 * Install Stardog Triplestore (<http://stardog.com/>) and start it in background. Create a database with the name _qanary_. All the triples generated by the components will be stored in the _qanary_ database.

 * Run the pipeline component:
   ```
   cd qanary_pipeline-template/target/
   java -jar target/qa.pipeline-<version>.jar
   ```

* Use the Web console of the qanary pipeline <http://localhost:8080/#/overview> to see the status of the available components (at the time no components are running).

* After `maven build` jar files will be generated in the corresponding folders of the Qanary components. For example, to start the Alchemy API components:
  ```
  cd qanary_component-Alchemy-NERD
  java -jar target/qa.Alchemy-NERD-0.1.0.jar
  ```
 
* After running corresponding jar files, you can see Springboot application running on <http://localhost:8080/#/overview> that will tell the status of currently running components.

* Now your pipeline is ready to use. Go to <http://localhost:8080/startquestionansweringwithtextquestion>. Here you can find a User Interface to interact for adding question via web interface, and then select the components you need to include in the pipeline via checking a checkbox for each component. Press the start button and you are ready to go!
